  - We are looking for an web application that utilizes a MVC architecture using spring boot.  
  - We need to see dynamic content being rendered and the ability to add content to the application through an HTML form.
  - Upon submission we should have an application that starts and passes all tests in the test folder.
  - Prepare a custom README.md file.  Smart Columbus Open Data Enthusiasts provide a good resource for what an README.md could look like [here.](https://github.com/SCODEMeetup/scode-repo-template/blob/master/README.md)
